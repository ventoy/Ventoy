  SimpleFileSystem protocol as defined in the UEFI 2.0 specification.

  The SimpleFileSystem protocol is the programmatic access to the FAT (12,16,32)
  file system specified in UEFI 2.0. It can also be used to abstract a file
  system other than FAT.

  UEFI 2.0 can boot from any valid EFI image contained in a SimpleFileSystem.
