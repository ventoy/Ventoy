* Obsolete *

This file is now largely obsolete, considering
it refers to Squashfs 2.1 (which was released in 2006)
and older releases.

GENERAL INFORMATION ON PERFORMANCE TESTS
----------------------------------------

The following performance tests were based on two file sets: the
liveCD filesystem from the Ubuntu liveCD (Warty release), and the
liveCD filesystem from the Damn Small Linux liveCD (release 0.8.4).
The Ubuntu liveCD filesystem was used to test filesystem performance
from CDROM and hard disk for Zisofs, Cloop, Squashfs 2.0 and Squashfs2.1.
CRAMFS filesystem performance could not be tested for this filesystem
bacause it exceeds the maximum supported size of CRAMFS.  To test
CRAMFS performance against Squashfs, the liveCD filesystem from
Damn Small Linux was used.

NOTE: the usual warnings apply to these results, they are provided for
illustrative purposes only, and due to different hardware and/or file data, you
may obtain different results.  As such the results are provided "as is" without
any warranty (either express or implied) and you assume all risks as to their
quality and accuracy.
