File IO Lib Options
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

See defines in fat_opts.h:

FATFS_IS_LITTLE_ENDIAN 	[1/0]
  Which endian is your system? Set to 1 for little endian, 0 for big endian.

FATFS_MAX_LONG_FILENAME	[260]
  By default, 260 characters (max LFN length). Increase this to support greater path depths.

FATFS_MAX_OPEN_FILES
  The more files you wish to have concurrently open, the greater this number should be.
  This increases the number of FL_FILE file structures in the library, each of these is around 1K in size (assuming 512 byte sectors).

FAT_BUFFER_SECTORS
  Minimum is 1, more increases performance.
  This defines how many FAT sectors can be buffered per FAT_BUFFER entry.

FAT_BUFFERS
  Minimum is 1, more increases performance.
  This defines how many FAT buffer entries are available.
  Memory usage is FAT_BUFFERS * FAT_BUFFER_SECTORS * FAT_SECTOR_SIZE

FATFS_INC_WRITE_SUPPORT
  Support file write functionality.

FAT_SECTOR_SIZE
  Sector size used by buffers. Most likely to be 512 bytes (standard for ATA/IDE).

FAT_PRINTF
  A define that allows the File IO library to print to console/stdout.
  Provide your own printf function if printf not available.

FAT_CLUSTER_CACHE_ENTRIES
  Size of cluster chain cache (can be undefined if not required).
  Mem used = FAT_CLUSTER_CACHE_ENTRIES * 4 * 2
  Improves access speed considerably.

FATFS_INC_LFN_SUPPORT 	[1/0]
  Enable/Disable support for long filenames.

FATFS_DIR_LIST_SUPPORT 	[1/0]
  Include support for directory listing.

FATFS_INC_TIME_DATE_SUPPORT  [1/0]
  Use time/date functions provided by time.h to update creation & modification timestamps.

FATFS_INC_FORMAT_SUPPORT
  Include support for formatting disks (FAT16 only).

FAT_PRINTF_NOINC_STDIO
  Disable use of printf & inclusion of stdio.h
